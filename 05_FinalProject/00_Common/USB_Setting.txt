ðŸ›  Step-by-Step Instructions to setting NetworkManager

1. Delete any existing config for usb0 (if present):
    > sudo nmcli connection delete usb0
    > sudo nmcli connection delete usbnet
    
    (These may fail if they don't exist â€” that's okay.)

2. Create a static connection profile for usb0:
    > sudo nmcli connection add type ethernet ifname usb0 con-name usbnet \
    > ipv4.addresses 192.168.137.2/24 \
    > ipv4.gateway 192.168.137.1 \
    > ipv4.dns 8.8.8.8 \
    > ipv4.method manual

    ðŸ”§ This assigns the Pi a static IP 192.168.137.2 and tells it the Windows host is 192.168.137.1 (default for Internet Connection Sharing).

3. Bring up the connection:
    > sudo nmcli connection up usbnet

    You should now have:
        A static IP on usb0
        No fallback to 169.254.x.x
        Working default route and DNS

4. Verify:
    > ip a show usb0
    > ip route
    > ping 192.168.137.1
    > ping 8.8.8.8
